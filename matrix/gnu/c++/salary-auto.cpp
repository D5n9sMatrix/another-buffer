/*
If we replace the do while loop with a do until loop, the code will execute through the loop one time,
printing the message once. This is because the condition test is applied only at the bottom of the loop. A
do until loop will always execute one time, even if the condition test on the do until is false, because
the test is not evaluated until after the loop executes one time. The result in this example is that the say
instruction executes once and displays one output line:
