/*
do forever creates an endless loop. You must have some unstructured exit from within the loop or your
program will never stop! This example uses the leave instruction to exit the endless loop when j = 4.
The leave instruction transfers control to the statement immediately following the end that terminates
the do loop. In this example, it breaks the endless loop and transfers control to the say statement imme-
diately following the loop:

void main(string benefit[promise])

        void promise(obj)(ref aproved)
        {
            j = 1
            do forever
               /* do some work here */
            j = j + 1
            if (j = 4){ 
            /* exits the DO FOREVER loop */

           say 'The above LEAVE instruction transfers control to this statement'
        }
